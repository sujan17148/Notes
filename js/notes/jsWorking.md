# How JavaScript Works

- Everything in JS happens **inside an Execution Context**.
- JavaScript is a **synchronous, single-threaded language**.

  - üîπ It can only execute **one command at a time**.
  - üîπ Being synchronous, JS executes the next line **only after the current line finishes**.

# Execution Context (EC) in JavaScript

An **Execution Context** is an **abstract concept** (an idea) that holds the **environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed**.
_(This means the execution context stores everything JS needs to run your code.)_

> üí° **Basically, it‚Äôs a container that keeps all the information JS needs to run a piece of code.**

---

## Components of Execution Context

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables (Memory Block)

- Stores **variables and their values**, **functions**, as key-value pairs.

**JS engine allocates memory for:**

- **Variables:**

  - `var` ‚Üí initialized with `undefined`
  - `let` & `const` ‚Üí in **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** until assignment

- **Functions:** Fully hoisted with their definitions
- **Scope chain:** Determines variable accessibility
- **`this` binding:** Determines the value of `this` in context

> üìù Think of it as a **memory block where memory is reserved** before code runs.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Thread of Execution (Code Block)

- JS engine executes the code **line by line**.
- Values are assigned to variables, functions are invoked, and expressions are evaluated.

> üìù Think of it as a **thread of execution that runs instructions from the memory block**.

---

# Example: Creation & Execution Flow

```javascript
console.log(a); // Line 1
var a = 10; // Line 2
let b = 20; // Line 3

function sum(x, y, z) {
  // Line 4
  var result = x + y + z;
  return result;
}

const sumResult = sum(a, b, 30);
console.log(result); // Line 5
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creation Phase (Memory Block)

JS engine scans the code **before execution** and reserves memory:

```text
Memory Block (Global EC):
a ‚Üí undefined        // var is hoisted
b ‚Üí TDZ               // let in Temporal Dead Zone
sum ‚Üí function(x, y, z) { ... } // function fully hoisted
sumResult ‚Üí TDZ
this ‚Üí global object
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Phase (Thread of Execution / Code Block)

JS executes **line by line**:

```javascript
// Line 1
console.log(a); // prints undefined (var hoisted)

// Line 2
var a = 10; // memory now a ‚Üí 10

// Line 3
let b = 20; // leaves TDZ, memory now b ‚Üí 20

// Line 4
// function sum already in memory ‚Üí nothing changes

// Line 5
const sumResult = sum(a, b, 30);
// üîπ Creates a new Function Execution Context (for sum)

// Function EC Creation Phase
let x = undefined;
let y = undefined;
let z = 30;
var result = undefined;

// Function EC Execution Phase
x = 10;
y = 20;
result = x + y + z; // result = 60
return result; // üîπ returns value to sumResult, context shifts back to global

// üîπ The execution context for sum function is deleted after it finishes
console.log(sumResult); // prints 60

// üîπ Once the whole code has executed, the global execution context is also deleted
```

---

### Memory Block After Execution

```text
Global Memory Block:
a ‚Üí 10
b ‚Üí 20
sum ‚Üí function(x, y, z) { ... }
sumResult ‚Üí 60
this ‚Üí global object
```

---

### Functions & Hoisting

| Function Type             | var / let / const | Creation Phase | Execution Phase |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Function Declaration      | N/A               | Fully hoisted  | Already usable  |
| Function Expression       | var               | undefined      | Assigned value  |
| Arrow Function Expression | let / const       | TDZ            | Assigned value  |

# Execution Context & Call Stack in JavaScript

## üìå Problem

Whenever a JavaScript program runs, a **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created.

- This GEC stays alive until the entire code has finished running.
- Each time a function is invoked, a **new Execution Context (EC)** is created.

üëâ If we keep calling **nested functions**, we could end up with a **large number of ECs**.  
This might seem like it could cause issues (e.g., memory overload or confusion in execution order).

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: The Call Stack

JavaScript solves this problem using the **Call Stack**.

- The **Global Execution Context** is pushed into the stack first.
- Whenever a function is invoked, its **Execution Context** is pushed on top of the stack.
- If that function has an inner function, its EC is also pushed on top.
- Once a function finishes execution, its EC is **popped out** of the stack.

This works like a **stack data structure (LIFO ‚Äì Last In, First Out)**:

- The most recent function pushed is the first one popped.
- Once all functions are done, only the **Global EC** remains, and when the program ends, it‚Äôs also cleared.

---

## üîë Key Takeaways

- **Execution Contexts** are created for global and function execution.
- **Nested functions** create multiple ECs.
- The **Call Stack** ensures smooth execution by managing them in **LIFO order**.



# Execution Stack / Call Stack in Async JavaScript

JavaScript is **single-threaded**, so it can't "pause" for things like timers or network requests.  
Instead, async operations are sent outside the call stack to other environments (**Web APIs / Node.js APIs**) which can handle them in the background.

These environments use **two types of queues**:

1. **Micro-task queue**: for Promises, network requests
2. **Macro-task queue**: for `setTimeout`, `setInterval`

## Working for `setTimeout`

- `setTimeout` is an anonymous function, so when invoked, it creates a **new execution context (EC)** which is **pushed into the call stack**.
- Inside the EC:
  - It registers its **callback function** along with the **timer** into Web APIs.
- The `setTimeout` EC is then **popped from the call stack**.
- When the timer completes, the Web API / event loop **pushes the callback into the macro-task queue**.
- When the **call stack is empty** (only the global EC remains):
  - The callback function‚Äôs **EC is created** and pushed onto the call stack.
  - The callback executes and is **popped after execution**.

‚úÖ **Key point**: The callback‚Äôs EC is **created only when dequeued from the macro-task queue**, not when `setTimeout` is called.

---

## Working of a Promise

### 1) Create a Promise

```js
const p = Promise.resolve("data");
```

- A Promise object is created in memory.
- No execution context (EC) for callbacks is created yet.

### 2) Register a `.then()` callback

```js
p.then(callback);
```

- The `callback` is stored inside the Promise‚Äôs internal list of reactions.
- Still nothing executes; no EC is created yet.

### 3) Promise settles (fulfills or rejects)

- When the Promise settles, its reaction (the stored `callback`) is queued into the **micro-task queue**.

### 4) Event loop schedules the micro-task

- When the **call stack is empty** (only Global EC remains), the event loop dequeues the micro-task.

### 5) Execute the callback

```js
// Micro-task runs
callback(); // EC is created ‚Üí pushed ‚Üí runs ‚Üí popped
```

- A new EC for `callback` is created and pushed onto the call stack.
- After execution, that EC is popped.

 ‚úÖ Key point: The Promise itself is an internal construct; only its callbacks run later via the micro-task queue.

---

## Async/Await Execution Flow

```js
async function foo() {
  await something();
  console.log("done");
}

foo();
```

### Flow

1. Calling `foo()` runs synchronously until the first `await`.
2. At `await`, execution of `foo` is paused; the remainder is scheduled as a **micro-task** to resume later.
3. Synchronous code outside `foo` continues executing.
4. When the awaited Promise settles, the remainder of `foo` (after `await`) is queued in the **micro-task queue**.
5. Event loop dequeues it when the stack is empty ‚Üí creates an EC for the resumed part ‚Üí executes ‚Üí pops.
